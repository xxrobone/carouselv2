# Carousel

Got a hint from a senior developer to do a scroll bar using simple javascript 
using the client width but also to check difference between scrollwidth and clienwidth

## some sources

remove scrollbar:

use the scrollLeft:

scrollWidth:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollWidth

clientWidth: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/clientWidth

could also have used .getBoundingClientRect function on the element
